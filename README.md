# Welcome to my github! 

My name is Mohamed and im really interested in mobile development and quit my full time job to go back to school for my computer science degree so I can pursue a career as an iOS developer. Most of my time is spent working in Xcode or Android Studio, and I enjoy figuring out how to build apps with clean architecture and a smooth user experience.

I like learning about app design and how to create interfaces that feel simple and minimal, but still powerful. Recently I’ve been diving into SwiftUI and architecture patterns like MVVM, always trying to improve the way I structure my projects.

Right now, I’m focused on growing as an iOS/Android developer and working toward building real world apps that people actually use... and hopefully making an impact that way :D

I’m always learning and never perfect, and I think that’s what makes me a great student.

# Here are some of my skills & tools:

Languages: Swift, Kotlin, C, Python

Frameworks & UI: SwiftUI, UIKit, Jetpack Compose

Tools: Xcode, Git/GitHub, Docker

Backend & APIs: Firebase, REST APIs, Cloudinary

Other interests: App architecture (MVVM), clean UI/UX, mobile performance optimization
